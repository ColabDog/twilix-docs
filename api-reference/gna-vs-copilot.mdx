title: Question Answering vs Copilot
---

While both [Question Answering](/api-reference/features/generative-qa) and
[CoPilot](/api-reference/features/copilot) provides responses to user questions,
there are major differences under the hood.

For `Question Answering` endpoint, the underlying language model is trained to provide the most factual answer based on the data available.

If accuracy is a requirement, `Question Answering` is recommend.

For `CoPilot` endpoint, the underlying model assumes that a human is actively checking the result,
and thus is will return as much information as possible that is relevant for the response.

If accuracy is not a requirement, `CoPilot` is generally recommend.
