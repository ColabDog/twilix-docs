<Note>
Note that this currently requires the URL of the pdf to be publically accessible. We do not currently support storage of the PDF. 
We recommend using an S3-like storage with public read access. If you would like us to support public uploads, feel free to message us on
Discord and we can provide an endpoint in the future to do so.
