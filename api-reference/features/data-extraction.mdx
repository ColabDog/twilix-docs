    text: `Ron DeSantis's long-awaited entry into the 2024 
            race for the White House was hit by technical 
            glitches after a Twitter livestream malfunctioned. 
            It meant the Florida governor's bid for the Republican 
            presidential nomination got under way 20 minutes late.
  
            He went on to use the event to champion his conservative 
            credentials, his anti-lockdown stance and education reforms.
  
            "I am running for president of the United States to lead our 
            great American comeback," he said.`,

      },

        "key": "political party",
        "description": "name of political party"
      },
      {

      }
      {

// send the request to extract data
axios({

    data: data
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
}).catch(error => {

});

// output:

// }

```

Notice how the "age" field is null! We can automatically detect data that's missing from text.
