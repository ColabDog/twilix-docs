# Example
```typescript generative-qa.ts

// we're going to be using axios to send the HTTP request
const axios = require('axios');


// define the request body data by specifying the text to extract data from,
// and the data you want to extra
let data = {
    collection: `insurancePdfs',
    userInputt: "Can I claim wear and tear?",
    fields: ['content', 'url', 'pageNumber'],
};


var conversationID;

// send the request to extract data
axios({
    url: "https://api.twilix.io/v1/generativeQA",
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer " + apiKey,
    },
    data: data
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);

    // set the conversationID and supply it for next API call
    conversationID = response.data.conversationID
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});

// output:
// {
//  "content": "No, you cannot claim wear and tear on insurance. 
//              Wear and tear is considered normal deterioration 
//              due to age and use, and is not covered by insurance."
//  "url": "...",
//  "pageNumber": 6
