# Why do we care?

RAG powers a number of important applications in society. These include: 

- Being able to find important information within PDFs
- Providing grounded generation of text to avoid hallucinations 
- Providing references for when generations happen

It consists of 2 main components:

1. Retrieval (usually from a database like a vector database)
2. Generation (usually in the form of a large language model)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation usually runs the following:
- Retrieving content from a database
- Generating something from the retrieved content
