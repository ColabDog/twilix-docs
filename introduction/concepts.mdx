title: "How to use Twilix"

To start using our AI services endpoints, there are main two steps required to get started:

## 1. Selecting Data
When using our AI services endpoints, you need to pass in data so BlitzChain has enough context to give you customized outputs. Depending on the service endpoint you're using, the data you pass into BlitzChain can either be from within your vectorstore, or from an external data source. 

If you choose to use data from your Twilix vectorstore, you can specify which data to feed into BlitzChain by defining a JSON object to query and filter for objects within specific collections. As an example, if you want to build a chatbot using our generative Q&A endpoint, you need to tell BlitzChain which object to use and in what collection it belongs to. 

Depending on your use case, you might not want to use data from your vectorstore. The good news is we offer you the flexibility to use data from an external sources instead (eg, passing in a 10 paragraph string for text summarization), which also will not affect the quality of the results in anyway.

<Tip>
Twilix is powered by **BlitzChain** under the hood. BlitzChain is our in-house version of LangChain that is superior in accuracy, speed, and cost. You don't directly interacte with BlitzChain, but you can influence what it outputs by defining what data to feed it in the request body.

## 2. Using the AI services endpoints
Once you have defined the data you want to use in the request body, you can choose which endpoint to invoke. There's not much more to say on this, so congratulations! You are now ready to use Twilix.
