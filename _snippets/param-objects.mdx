<ParamField body="objects" type="array" default="[]">
  An array of JSON objects
  ```
  [
      {"message": "Hi James!", "sender": "Bill"},
      {"message": "Hello!", "sender": "James"}
  ]
  ```
  <Note>
    If you are attaching an `id` to your object, 
    it is required to be a UUID, otherwise
    it will error. If you need the `id` field to be 
    stored as something else, it needs to be stored as something
    else like `_id` or `$id`.
  </Note>
  
  An example object:

  ```
  {"message": "Hi James!", "sender": "Bill"}
  ```
  An example object with a UUID as ID:
  ```
  {
    "id": "72657ef9-7359-47ce-9dda-fcf709ff381a", 
    "message": "Hi James!", 
    "sender": "Bill"
  }
  ```
</ParamField>
