<ParamField body="objects" type="array" default="[]">
  An array of JSON objects
  ```
  [
      {"message": "Hi James!", "sender": "Bill"},
      {"message": "Hello!", "sender": "James"}
  ]
  ```
  <Note>
    If you are attaching an `id` to your object, 
    it is required to be a UUID, otherwise
    it will error. If you need the `id` field to be 
    stored as something else, it needs to be stored as something
    else like `_id` or `$id`.
  </Note>
  <ParamField type="object" key="any">
    What type of object is it.
    ```
    {"message": "Hi James!", "sender": "Bill"}
    ```
    Or a traceable ID: 
    ```
    {
      "id": "72657ef9-7359-47ce-9dda-fcf709ff381a", "message": "Hi James!", "sender": "Bill"}
    ```
  </ParamField>
</ParamField>
