# Is BlitzChain right for you?

BlitzChain is right for you if you are:

- Looking for a hosted solution to implement things quickly
- You are looking to implement AI services into your service/product offering quickly without having to worry about vector databases, AI, etc.
- Looking to only configure the most important parameters and aren't looking for tail-case improvements just yet.
- You tried LangChain, LlamaIndex and couldn't get the best results out of the box and instead of researching 20 different options to see which ones works best for your use case, you want something quick with us where we did all the research already.

BlitzChain is not right for you if:

- you want high customizability
- you are someone obssessed with ML / AI and want to test your own solutions (but we'd love for you to join us!)
