# Intro

You can use suggest message in our TypeScript SDK to power important use cases such as: 

- Responding to an email thread
- Drafting cold messages or emails
- Crafting personalised invitations or responses

```typescript
// Start a conversation
emailObject = {
       emailThreadID: 123,
       emailID: "email-1",
       author: "rahul",
       content: "Hi David, checking in how are you?",
       responseEmailID: None,
       attachments: None
}

emailObject2 = {
       emailThreadID: 123,
       emailID: "email-2",
       author: "jacky",
       content: "I'm great thanks! Let's catch up for coffee when you are free.",
       responseEmailID: "email-1",
       attachments: ["www.s3.objects.com/GET"]
}

twilix.bulkInsert(
       'email-conversations',
       objects=[emailObject, emailObject2]
)

suggestion = twilix.autoSuggest(
       'email-conversations',
       {
              where: {
                     field: emailThreadID,
                     operator: "Equals",
                     value: 123
              }
       }
)

print(suggestion)
```
