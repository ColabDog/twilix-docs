# Intro

You can use suggest message in our TypeScript SDK to power important use cases such as: 

- Responding to an email thread
- Drafting cold messages or emails
- Crafting personalised invitations or responses

```typescript
// Start a conversation
emailObject = {
       emailThreadID: 123,
       emailID: "email-1",
       author: "rahul",
       content: "Hi David, checking in how are you?",
       responseEmailID: None,
       attachments: None
}

emailObject2 = {
       emailThreadID: 123,
       emailID: "email-2",
       author: "jacky",
       content: "I'm great thanks! Let's catch up for coffee when you are free.",
       responseEmailID: "email-1",
       attachments: ["www.s3.objects.com/GET"]
}

fetch(
       "https://api.twilix.io/collection/bulkInsert",
       {
              headers: {
                     Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
              }
       },
       {
              collection: "emailConversation",
              objects: [emailObject, emailObject2]
       }
)

suggestion = fetch(
       "https://api.twilix.io/collection/suggestMessage",
       {
              headers: {
                     Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
              }
       },
       {
              collection: "emailConversation"
       }
)

print(suggestion)
```
