### Inserting PDF

```python
collection.insert_pdf(
    "https://www.founders.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/PFC%20terms%20and%20conditions_updated_2022.pdf"
)
```

## Asking Questions

You can ask a simple question in just 1 line of code:

```python
collection.generative_qa(
    user_input="What is this about?",
    prompt_fields=["section", "content"]
)
```

### Moving into conversations

If you want conversations, simply supply it a specific
conversation ID which can then be referenced later on.
Twilix manages storage of these conversations for users.

```python
collection.generative_qa(
    user_input="What is this about?",
    conversation_id="sampleConversation",
    prompt_fields=["section", "content"]
)
```
