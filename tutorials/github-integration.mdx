title: Insert Jupyter Notebooks with LangChain
description: "A tutorial showing how to integrate with Jupyter Notebook documentation with Twilix"
---

What this tutorial will cover:

- How you can use Langchain's loaders to insert into Twilix
- How you can convert Jupyter Notebooks into Twilix
- Demonstrate how we built Microsoft's Guidance in just a few lines of code!

In addition, we open-source our Jupyter Notebook splitting strategy in
this tutorial to help others who are also looking to find better
ways to index these notebooks.

## Installation

```
pip install -q langchain
pip install -q GitPython
```

## Set-up 
### Cloning a repository

Download any open-source github repository using the code below.

```python
from git import Repo
repo = Repo.clone_from(
    "https://github.com/microsoft/guidance", to_path="./guidance"
)
branch = repo.head.reference
```

### Using LangChain's Loaders
Now, we want to use LangChain's loaders.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import GitLoader
loader = GitLoader(repo_path="./guidance", branch=branch)
data = loader.load()
```

### Processing for Jupyter Notebooks

These loaders will be used to create and store examples. 

```python
nb_examples = [
    x for x in data if 'pynb' in x.metadata['file_path']
]
file_paths = [nb.metadata['file_path'] for nb in nb_examples]
```

Once you load in the notebooks, you can then convert them into strings
```python
# Parse in string appropriately depending on their type
def get_cell_string(cell: dict):
  content = ""
  
  if cell['cell_type'] == 'markdown':
    content += cell['source']
  elif cell['cell_type'] == 'code':
    content += f"""```python
{cell['source']}
"""
  return content
```

You can then insert Jupyter Notebooks

```python
from nbformat import read
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
docs = []
for notebook_path in tqdm(file_paths):
  with open('guidance/' + notebook_path, 'r') as f:
      notebook = read(f, as_version=4)

  cells = notebook['cells']

  # For each cell, we include the before and after markdown and code
  all_content = []
  for i, cell in enumerate(cells):
    content = get_cell_string(cell)
    all_content.append(
        {
            "content": content
        }
    )


  # For each code block include previous and enxt content cell
  # below are an example indices
  # [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 7], [6, 8]]
  # Ignore the terrible code 
  content_clean = ["\n".join([c['content'] for c in all_content[(i-1):(i + 1)]])for i in range(1, len(all_content))]
  docs += [{"content": c, "file_path": notebook_path} for c in content_clean]

# You can then quickly check how many them there are 
len(docs)
# 432
```

# Inserting into Twilix

<Snippet file="installation.mdx" />
<Snippet file="installation-python.mdx" />

```python
from blitzchain import Client
TWILIX_API_KEY = "..."
client = Client(TWILIX_API_KEY)
collection = client.Collection("microsoftGuidanceDemo")
```

### Quick sense check

You can do a sense check of the number of objects in a collection.

```python
collection.count()
```

## Generative Question Answering

Ask Microsoft Guidance simple questions and have it return to you useful answers.

```python
# Ask Microsoft Guidance questions about their docs
collection.generative_qa(
    # Ask it any query
    user_input="What is Anachronism?",
    # Use your answer field
    answer_fields=['content']
)
```

## Co-Pilot

Ask Microsoft Guidance to help you write code to integrate into your application

```python
collection.copilot(
    # Ask it any query
    user_input="What is token healing?",
    # Use your answer field
    answer_fields=['content']
)
```
