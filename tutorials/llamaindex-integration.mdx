title: Integrate with LlamaIndex in 2 minutes
description: "A tutorial showing how to integrate with LlamaIndex"

What this tutorial will cover:

- How can you use LlamaIndex's connectors to get data.
- How you can then store/retrieve data in Twilix to then generate answers

## Installation

<Snippet file="installation.mdx" />

<Snippet file="installation-python.mdx" />

## Using LlamaIndex's Loaders

Before starting, make sure you install Llama Index using the pip install below.

```bash
pip install -q llama-index
```

You can then get any loader from LlamaIndex. Here is an example:

```python
from llama_index import download_loader

YoutubeTranscriptReader = download_loader("YoutubeTranscriptReader")

loader = YoutubeTranscriptReader()
documents = loader.load_data(ytlinks=['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hxeDjAxvJ8'])
```

Once you have retrieved the documents, you will want to insert them into Twilix. To
help with this, we built out our Python package which we called `BlitzChain`.

## Instantiating Twilix

All API requests requires an API key. To get your API key, sign up for free at https://app.twilix.io.

```python
from blitzchain import Client
TWILIX_API_KEY = "..."
client = Client(TWILIX_API_KEY)
collection = client.Collection("marcAndreessenInterviewDemo")
```

### Pre-processing

We convert everything to a string to avoid any potential inconsistent data
structure issues.

```python
docs = [d.dict() for d in documents]
# Convert everything to a string
for d in docs:
  for k, v in d.items():
    d[k] = str(v)
```


## Inserting into Twilix

```python
result = collection.insert_objects(
  objects=docs,
  # Here you can specify you only want to split on the text field
  split_on_field='text',
  # Here, you can specify that you ONLY want to vectorize the text field
  fields_for_vectorization=['text'],
)
print(result)
```

### Check using count 

You can then run a count of the documents to check they have been inserted properly.
Below, we can see what happened.

```python
# You can check the count of the documents here
collection.count()
```

## Run question-answering

Running question-answering now is as simple as 1 line of code:

```python
collection.generative_qa(
    # Ask it any query
    user_input="Summarize this please",
    # Use your answer field
    answer_fields=['text'],
)
```

If you are interested in further tweaking this, we recommend checking out 

<Card title="Customize Generative QA" icon="link" href="/api-reference/features/generative-q&a">
    You can read more about this endpoint and how you can integrate this into 
    a variety of clients such as JS, Go, etc. and how you can test different 
    things out such as re-ranking and fields.
