## What is Semantic Search?

Semantic search in the context of vector search involves leveraging embedding techniques to enhance the accuracy 
and relevance of search results. By employing vector representations, semantic search strives to capture the 
inherent meaning and contextual nuances of words, phrases, and documents. This approach goes beyond traditional 
keyword matching, enabling a more refined and context-aware search experience for users.
