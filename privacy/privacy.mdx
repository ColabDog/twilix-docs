# Privacy

Your data is sensitive and we respect that. We take privacy very seriously. The aim of this section is to be transparent about how we are storing and processing your data and the services we are using in the backend.

## Data Storage

We store the data you provide us in a vector database called weaviate. The reason why we have to store your data is because it allows us to bring you solutions that are customized to your data. With this in mind, we are hosting your vector database on a private network to ensure that no one else but your organization, the Twilix API Key holder, has access to this data.

As a developer, you have full control over what data you want to add, update, or delete, just like a traditional database.

Data Usage
We use OpenAI's GPT-4 to perform language tasks such as summarization, text suggestions, and question answering. In accordance with OpenAI's data privacy policies, we explicitly opt-out of all data collection which means OpenAI cannot use your data to train their models. You can read more about this here.
